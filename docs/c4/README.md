# Architecture

We're using [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) to visualize our architecture.

## Getting Started

We're using the [Structurizr Lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite) as a tool
here. To run the Structurizr Lite:

```bash
mise run up
```

After that, check out http://localhost:8090.

To stop it:

```bash
mise run down
```
